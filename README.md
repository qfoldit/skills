## Included Agent Skills

qFoldIT Skills are modular AI capabilities. Each Skill contains: domain knowledge, workflows, validation rules, examples, and MCP integration points where relevant. Folder names below match exactly what's in `skills/` -- use them to install/reference a specific skill.

Repository: https://github.com/qfoldit/skills/

## Scientific AI Skills

### `skills/qfold` -- Quantum Molecular Folding

2D HP-lattice protein folding (Dill, 1985) with a QAOA-style circuit on Amazon Braket LocalSimulator, plus optional delegation to a full qFold MCP server when available.

### `skills/bionemo-agent-toolkit` -- Structure Prediction

Protein/complex structure prediction via AlphaFold2 (NVIDIA BioNeMo NIM) and AlphaFold3 (local Docker), plus DiffDock docking and MolMIM molecule generation. **A compatible client, not an official NVIDIA or Google DeepMind integration.**

### `skills/quantum` -- VQE Simulator

Classical statevector VQE simulator (numpy-only), validated against exact diagonalization and a real published H2/STO-3G benchmark (arXiv:2209.09564, matches -1.1373 Hartree to 4 decimal places).

---

## Bioindustrial & Environmental Skills

### `skills/mining` -- Bioprocesses in Mining

Bio-oxidation, biosorption (gold-cyanide/copper/REE/lithium), and cyanide biodegradation kinetics for metal recovery.

### `skills/prospecting` -- Microbial Ore Prospecting

Indicator-taxa statistics on microbial abundance data for biogeochemical mineral exploration.

### `skills/meor` -- Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery

Bacterial growth, biosurfactant production, IFT reduction, and incremental oil recovery modeling.

### `skills/oilgas` -- CO2 Corrosion in Pipelines

Pipeline corrosion rate and remaining-wall-life estimation (de Waard-Milliams correlation).

---

## Biological Simulation Skills

### `skills/l-systems` -- L-System Fractals & Plants

Procedural plant/fractal generation (Koch, dragon, Sierpinski, branching plants) rendered as SVG.

### `skills/plant-growth` -- Plant Nutrition & Light Model

Growth rate, morphology, and secondary-metabolite indices from NPK nutrition and light spectrum -- qualitative/illustrative, not species-calibrated. Can feed `skills/l-systems` to visualize the resulting shape.

---

## Materials & Industrial Skills

### `skills/plastic-characterization` -- Plastic Pyrolysis Estimator

Pyrolysis oil/gas/char yield ranges and chlorine-contamination risk for mixed plastic feedstock.

---

## VR / Interactive Molecular Dynamics

### `skills/nanover` -- NanoVer VR Bridge

Bridges qFoldIT structures (from `qfold`/`bionemo-agent-toolkit`) into **NanoVer**, a real, independently published and maintained open-source framework (Intangible Realities Laboratory -- IRL2, University of Santiago de Compostela & University of Bristol; Stroud et al. 2025, *JOSS* 10(110):8118, DOI [10.21105/joss.08118](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.08118)) for collaborative interactive molecular dynamics in VR. qFoldIT's role is a thin adapter only -- **NanoVer is not a qFoldIT invention; citing the source publication is required** whenever this skill's output is used. Requires a local conda install of `nanover-server`.

---

## Digital Twin & Engine Skills

These share one engine-neutral format -- the **Universal Assembly Graph (UAG)**, schema in `skills/game-designer/references/uag_schema.md`. `game-designer` produces a UAG; `digital-twin-builder` adds simulation-grade physical semantics; each engine skill below exports the (enriched) UAG to one target platform. Every engine skill validates against `skills/game-designer/scripts/uag_validate.py` before exporting -- and every skill states plainly whether its target integration is official or community-maintained.

| Skill folder | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/game-designer` | produces the UAG (engine-neutral) | qFoldIT-authored |
| `skills/digital-twin-builder` | enriches UAG with physical/simulation semantics | qFoldIT-authored |
| `skills/unreal-world-builder` | Unreal Engine | ✅ Official (Epic Games MCP plugin) |
| `skills/unity-experience-builder` | Unity | ⚠️ Community ([CoplayDev/unity-mcp](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp) -- **not affiliated with Unity Technologies**; MIT-licensed; cite Wu & Barnett, "MCP-Unity: Protocol-Driven Framework for Interactive 3D Authoring," 2025, DOI [10.1145/3757376.3771417](https://doi.org/10.1145/3757376.3771417) if used in research) |
| `skills/unigine-simulation-engineer` | UNIGINE 2 / UNIGINE 2 Sim | ✅ Official pattern (unigine-engine/ai-docs), docs-grounded to avoid hallucinated API calls |
| `skills/openusd-architect` | OpenUSD / NVIDIA Omniverse | ✅ Official ([NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-usd-agents](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-usd-agents)) |
| `skills/apple-spatial-designer` | RealityKit / visionOS / USDZ | ✅ Official Xcode<->Claude Agent SDK integration; RealityKit specifics from public docs + community skills, not one single authoritative source |
| `skills/threejs-web-designer` | Three.js / React Three Fiber / WebXR | Community ecosystem; no single official skill exists for this stack |

**Note on Unity:** this table's `unity-experience-builder` (community `CoplayDev/unity-mcp`) is a distinct project from the *official* Unity MCP Server shipped by Unity Technologies as part of Unity AI Beta (`com.unity.ai.assistant` package, Unity 6.0+) referenced elsewhere in this ecosystem's `claude_desktop_config.json` -- the two are not interchangeable and expose different tool sets.
